#### Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a system to help students better prepare for driving tests. Our client, DriverPass, wanted a system offering online practice exams, scheduling for driving lessons, and secure data management. The project aimed to meet these requirements with a web-based, user-friendly solution supporting multiple user roles, including customers, secretaries, and administrators.

#### Strengths in Project Execution
One of my strengths in this project was creating detailed UML diagrams that clearly outlined system processes and user interactions. These diagrams guided a structured approach to system design, effectively translating user needs into functional and non-functional requirements.

#### Areas for Revision
If I could revise one aspect of my work, I would focus on the activity diagrams to improve process clarity by adding more granular actions within each use case. This would enhance the flow understanding for developers and stakeholders.

#### User-Centric Approach
I interpreted the userâ€™s needs from the initial requirements gathering and implemented them through clearly defined system functions, such as lesson scheduling and account management. Ensuring the system addressed user goals, preferences, and security needs was vital for an intuitive user experience.

#### Design Approach and Future Strategies
My design approach focused on iterative refinement and alignment with client requirements. In future projects, I would continue to use UML diagrams early in the design phase, along with user stories and scenario mapping, to better visualize and address the unique needs of each user role in the system.
